## Problem

Although there is a lot of public data available (ex: PhonePe Pulse, RBI Reports, sandbox.data.gov) there are hardly any tools or common public platforms to analyze, derive intelligence and share one's analysis on the data in a comprehensible form.

## Solution

We created a platform where users can analyze, visualize the data and create their own dashboards which then can be shared for others to use and see. In this way, we'll empower the community to come together and create meaningful dashboards based on the open data which will contribute to the open digital public goods initiative.
